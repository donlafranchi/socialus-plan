# SocialUs — planning repo (`socialus-plan`)

Local discovery app: buy, sell, trade, gather. Beta 2026-10-30 (soft target); production April–May 2027. This repo holds SocialUs's decisions, scenarios and roadmap — what's next to build. App code lives in the sibling repo `socialus-web` (Vercel deploy on push to main; Supabase project `socialus-db`); palette, screens, mockups and design research in `socialus-design`. **The method — how agents work, the process absolutes, the pipeline, the lessons — is `ops-pattern`**, a sibling checkout; paths written `ops-pattern/…` are there. Which folder holds what: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § The repos.

## Decision rule

Every agent, every decision, word for word from Don. Method detail: `ops-pattern/process/PIPELINE.md` § Decision rule.

```
DECISION RULE (2026-10-04, Don)
1. Look first: before designing or deciding anything, find what established platforms do for this exact use case. Name 2–3 precedents with links (e.g. Google, Apple HIG, Airbnb, Meetup, Yelp, Stripe, Linear).
2. Choose: pick the most relevant and elegant option for SocialUs, the simplest one that fits our rulings.
3. Well-worn path: if a clear, established pattern exists, decide and build it yourself. Label the Issue/PR "Path: well-worn", list the precedents, and don't wait for the PM.
4. New territory: if there's no well-worn path, the precedents conflict, or it touches a ruling, legal or privacy exposure, money, or member trust, label it "Path: new territory" and bring it to the PM as A/B/C with a recommendation before building.
5. When unsure which it is, say which in one line and lean toward deciding: the PM's time is the scarcest resource.
```

## Read first, every session

1. `STATUS.md` — what is true now. One screen. **Generated, never hand-edited** — see *Generated files* below.
2. `ROADMAP.md` — Now / Next / Later / Won't.
3. `ops-pattern/process/ABSOLUTES.md` and `product/ABSOLUTES.md` — the eight absolutes, six process and two product. The four-harms test and the rule that admits another are stated once, in the process file. Cite an absolute by its slug in brackets (`[public-is-draft]`), never by number. Everything else is a guideline; break one if you can say why.
4. `ops-pattern/process/PIPELINE.md` — the five kinds of work and how each moves.
5. `constraints/planning.md` — every ratified decision that binds this tier, one line each. Generated from the `[binds …]` tags in `DECISIONS.md`; never edit it.

## Where truth lives

- **How the system works:** the code in `socialus-web`. If the code can answer it, read the code, don't write it down.
- **Why it is that way:** `DECISIONS.md`. One dated line per **live** ruling. A superseded one is deleted and named in one `[replaces …]` tag on its replacement; git holds the rest ([newer-decision-wins]).
- **What is decided but not built:** `planning/` scenarios with `status: approved`, and `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Anything that spans the project** — open questions, which check guards which criterion, which ruling binds which tier, which risk is due — **is generated from inline markers, never maintained.** The pattern, and what it refuses: `ops-pattern/process/LIVING-DOCS.md`.
- **What is not yet decided:** an `[open-question owner=… raised=…]` marker, inline where the question was raised — in the file its answer will change. Never a list: the index is `STATUS.md` § Open questions, generated. Grammar, placement and what closes one: `ops-pattern/process/PIPELINE.md` § Open questions; `scripts/lint.sh` enforces it.
- **What might be built someday:** `IMAGINE.md`. Nothing there is a commitment. Scenarios may not cite it.
- **What the product is:** `product/foundation/model.md` — Don's own statement of the model. Every other product document answers to it; where one disagrees, the other is the thing to fix.
- **The product model:** `product/` — nouns, verbs, surfaces, systems. Must match the code and `model.md`. If it doesn't, fix the doc in the same session you notice.
- **What may never be broken:** `ops-pattern/process/ABSOLUTES.md` (process) and `product/ABSOLUTES.md` (member-facing). Two files, one test — the test lives in the process file.
- **How work moves, and what went wrong before:** `ops-pattern/process/` — `PIPELINE.md` (the five kinds), `LESSONS.md` (append-only), `LIVING-DOCS.md` (the pattern behind the generated docs, and why authored docs are pruned), `ABSOLUTES.md`. Only `process/SETUP.md` (standing up a second machine; read once per machine, never per session) lives here.
- **The tooling:** `scripts/` is vendored from `ops-pattern`. A change to how a marker, lint or generated view works is method: make it in `ops-pattern` first, then copy the file here in the same session.

**A concept lives in exactly one place.** Two documents describing the same thing is how this repo has failed before, so routing it is a rule, not a preference:

- **`product/` — nouns, verbs, surfaces — is the spine.** Every entry carries its own status, so one line holds both horizons: *"responses: thumbs up now, four states later."* **The future version of a thing is a status on its existing entry, never a second description somewhere else.**
- **`IMAGINE.md` is a waiting room, not a parallel library.** It holds only ideas that do not yet have a noun, a verb, or a surface.
- **When an idea acquires one, it moves into the spine and leaves `IMAGINE.md`.** Entries move out. They are never copied out — a copy is two descriptions, which is the thing this rule exists to prevent.

**`product/systems/` is depth, not a competing status.** Systems docs describe *how* a concept works. **They never state whether it ships.** The spine owns status; systems own detail. That is why they are not a fourth tracking layer and why the one-place rule does not make them redundant — they are not a second answer to the same question, they are the answer to a different one. A systems doc that starts declaring what ships has drifted, and the fix is to move that sentence to the spine, not to delete the doc.

**The test: does it have a shape — a noun, a verb, or a surface? Then the spine. If not, `IMAGINE.md`.** Worked example: *responses* have a noun and a verb, so the eventual four-state design is a status line on the response entry in `nouns.md`. *The Ticketmaster thesis* has none of the three — it is a claim about a market, not a shape — so it stays in `IMAGINE.md` until something about the product gives it one.

If a directory isn't listed here, don't read it. Anything not in the tree is not current — git history is the archive (`git log`, tag `archive-2026-09`).

## Generated files

`STATUS.md`, `README.md`, `constraints/` and `PLATFORM-*.md` are written by scripts and **committed by a workflow, not by a person**. A hand-edit to either is lost on the next run.

| File | Written by | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `STATUS.md` | `scripts/status.sh`, wrapping `scripts/state.sh` and `scripts/markers.py` | `.github/workflows/status.yml` — push to `main`, daily 13:05 UTC, and *Actions → status → Run workflow*, which works from a phone |
| `README.md` | `scripts/view.sh` | the same workflow |
| `DASHBOARD.md` (plain text), `dashboard/index.html` (colour) | `scripts/dashboard.py`, reading `socialus-web` Issues and PRs | by hand at each 5am/5pm handoff (`ops-pattern/process/DISPATCH.md`); no workflow, the repo has no Actions minutes |
| `constraints/planning.md`, `constraints/code.md` | `python3 scripts/markers.py constraints` | by hand after a `DECISIONS.md` change — `scripts/lint.sh` fails until it is run |
| `PLATFORM-IOS.md`, `PLATFORM-ANDROID.md` | `python3 scripts/markers.py platform`, from `[platform …]` markers | by hand after a marker changes — `scripts/lint.sh` fails until it is run |

**Nothing here asks you to remember to run anything.** A skill for this was written and never installed, so it never ran once and `STATUS.md` went stale naming the wrong launch blocker — the whole point is that the refresh does not depend on anyone thinking of it (lesson 27, and lesson 15 before it). To refresh by hand anyway: `bash scripts/status.sh`.

**The repos are public for now** (2026-10-01, Actions minutes), so anyone — the workflow included — can read `socialus-web`. If they go private, the workflow needs the `SOCIALUS_WEB_TOKEN` secret. Without it `STATUS.md` still regenerates and says, at the top and at the bottom, exactly what is missing.

## State

- A scenario's state is its frontmatter `status`: `draft` → `approved` → `building`. Shipped scenarios are deleted at sync.
- `gates: launch` in scenario frontmatter means the beta (2026-10-30), so the frontmatter stays as written.
- A ticket's state is its Issue label in `socialus-web`. Tickets never live here.
- What is approved for build is the scenario frontmatter (`status: approved`) plus the Issues in `socialus-web`. There is no separate bridge document — one existed, restated both sources, and went wrong.

## Who does what

| Who | Owns | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Don | rulings, judgment, domain knowledge — may open Issues in `socialus-web` directly | reads more than STATUS + ROADMAP unless he asks |
| Cowork — `plan` `review` `sync` `trim` | this repo: scenarios, STATUS, ROADMAP, DECISIONS, `product/`; may open Issues in `socialus-web` | commits code to `socialus-web`; hand-edits `README.md` |
| Code — `ticket` `build` | `socialus-web`: architecture notes, issues, code, PRs; branches, PRs and merges here too | writes scenarios, STATUS, ROADMAP or rulings here |

Code is the architect. Any ticket touching schema, RLS, or routes starts with a ≤20-line architecture note in the Issue. Cowork reviews it in a comment. Don sees it only if they disagree.

## How to talk to Don

- Bullets, one line each. No preamble, no recap, no narration.
- Name things in plain words; a number in brackets after, if useful.
- Questions reach him as A/B/C with one-line trade-offs and a recommendation. Ask only when a fact only he has is missing, or the call affects the deadline. **Never ask which of two rulings is true — the newer wins and work continues** ([newer-decision-wins]); two live rulings that genuinely conflict become a marked open question, not a message.
- Reports open: `Status: Done | Blocked | Question — one sentence. Next: the ask.` Detail on "expand".
- Email is not the best route to reach him — in-app is better; faster channels are TBD.
- End with the next action, not a summary.

## Commits

- Cowork commits its own doc changes here, on a branch. Message: `docs: what`.
- Code commits in `socialus-web`, branch per ticket. Who merges and when Don looks: `ops-pattern/process/PIPELINE.md` § Who checks what. A merge to main there deploys to production.
- **Every change goes by branch and PR** *(2026-10-05)*: main requires the `lint` check (ruleset "main: merges when green"), so a direct push is rejected. Auto-merge is on: `gh pr merge --auto --squash` merges once lint passes. The STATUS workflow earns the same check on its own commits (`.github/workflows/status.yml`).
- Anything bigger than a doc touch-up goes by branch and PR here. **Whoever does the work merges it, Code or Cowork** — self-merge is fine, and needs no approval and no second reviewer.
- Never cross-commit (guideline — the repo split enforces it). Never rewrite history ([production-asks-don]).

## Sessions

Two sessions in one working tree collide (lesson 9). Two rules, both cheap:

- **Every session's cwd is its own worktree — never the repo root.** The one-session-per-cwd guard keys on cwd, so a repo root shared by two sessions wedges both. This holds for read-only sessions too: reading is what takes the lock.
- **Worktrees live beside the repo, not inside it:** `../worktrees/{repo}/{branch}`. Inside the checkout, dozens of them make `.gitignore` load-bearing, bloat every tree walk, and leave stale metadata behind a crashed session (`git worktree prune`). Outside, the repo stays one repo.
- **A session that isn't committing uses `git --no-optional-locks status`.** Plain `git status` writes `.git/index.lock` to refresh the index, and a sandboxed session can't always unlink it afterwards — the next session then finds a stale lock. The flag skips the write.

## Naming

Schema names are durable; UI labels translate them. The table is in `product/foundation/nouns.md`. Language is pro-competition, for all Americans — see `product/foundation/what-this-is.md`.

- **Issue title:** `F060 · T142 · plain name`. Bugs/changes/chores: `bug · plain name` (or `change ·`, `chore ·`), with `Scenario: F###|none` in the body.
- **Branch:** `f060-t142-slug`. **Commit:** `F060/T142: what`.
- **Bugs/changes/chores carry the Issue number, not a ticket number** — they have no `T###`. Branch `bug-36-slug`, commit `bug #36: what` (likewise `change-`/`chore-`). Process work has no Issue (`ops-pattern/process/PIPELINE.md`), so it dates instead: branch `process-YYYY-MM-DD-slug`, commit `docs: what`. Every branch name carries something unique that needs no central counter — dozens of agents must be able to name a branch without asking anything.
- **Provenance is git:** `git log --grep F060` is everything built for that scenario.
- **No hand-maintained indexes.** A file a person reads to find out what is true goes stale between the moment it is written and the moment it is read, and then it lies — REGISTRY, MAP, TRACE, STAGE-LEDGER and JOURNAL all died of this (lesson 2). The test is *who reads it to be right*, not what format it is in: a file only a script compares is fine, because nothing believes it and drift shows up as diff noise on the next run. `accepted-risks/` is that — generated from advisor exports, read by `scripts/advisor-diff.sh`, never consulted to settle a question. `DECISIONS.md` settles questions.
