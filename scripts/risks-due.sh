# Accepted risks whose revisit condition has fired, or is close.
#
# SILENT WHEN NOTHING IS DUE, deliberately. A list that prints every day is a
# list nobody reads, and these are the things most easily forgotten precisely
# because somebody already decided they were fine.
#
# What "due" means, and why it is only ever a DATE here:
#   · past      — review_by has passed. Argue it again or delete it.
#   · soon      — review_by is within 21 days.
#   · triggered — a revisit_if condition that is not a date has fired. A script
#                 cannot know whether "the first report of illegal content"
#                 has happened, so it never claims to. Those conditions are
#                 printed alongside the dated ones so a person can answer them.
#
#   bash scripts/risks-due.sh          # dated entries that are due or close
#   bash scripts/risks-due.sh --all    # every accepted risk, with its condition
