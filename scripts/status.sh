# Writes STATUS.md. Never hand-edit STATUS.md — a hand-edit is lost on the next
# run. Re-run this, or trigger the `status` workflow.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A SKILL. A skill was written for this job
# (`process/skills/status/SKILL.md`, deleted 2026-09-19) and never once ran: it
# was never installed into any `.claude/skills/`, and even installed, a skill
# only fires when somebody thinks to invoke it. The defect being fixed is
# precisely that nobody invoked it. So the judgement the skill described is
# encoded here instead, as rules the script cannot forget:
#
#   · Never invent progress. A commit naming a ticket is not proof the ticket
#     is done; `state.sh` surfaces those as *check these* and that framing is
#     carried through untouched.
#   · `status: building` in frontmatter is a claim, not evidence. Said so.
#   · Anything this run could not check goes under "What this run could not
#     verify", which is never empty by default.
#   · Open questions come from inline markers, never from the previous file.
#
# It answers *where is this project*, not *what tickets exist*. The ticket list
# is `gh issue list`, which is always right; this does not copy it in.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/status.sh [path-to-socialus-web]
