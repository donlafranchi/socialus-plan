# `## Why` (added 2026-09-17) carries rationale — why this shape, what was
# rejected, how it relates to a neighbouring scenario. It exists because 12 of
# 37 scenarios already carried exactly that content under a dozen different
# ad-hoc headings, and deleting it to satisfy a linter would have destroyed the
# reasoning behind ratified decisions. It is NOT counted toward the 40 lines:
# the cap exists to keep a SPEC small enough to hold in your head, and rationale
# is not spec. A scenario whose Story + Acceptance + Not this exceeds 40 lines
# is still two scenarios, which is the rule PIPELINE.md states.
