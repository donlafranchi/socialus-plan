# Local kinds

**This is a seed list, not a category system.** `nouns.md` § Tag is ratified and
explicit: a tag is *"created, not picked from a fixed list"*, and the **Never**
line bars *"a coarse category a creator picks alongside it"*. Nothing here
reverses that, and nothing here should ever become a dropdown.

What it is for, both sanctioned by existing rulings:

1. **Seeding the initial tag list.** `DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-13 retired
   "Something else" and ruled *"its rows seed the initial tag list"*. A tag
   store that opens empty asks the first hundred creators to invent a
   vocabulary from nothing; one that opens with real words gives them something
   to recognise or reject. These are candidate words.
2. **A working set.** Six sample Pages are not enough to know whether Browse,
   the map or a card holds up. This is the variety a real metro has.

**Status is `draft` because half of it is proposed rather than observed.** Every
row below is marked. Don can accept or cut the proposed half without touching
the borrowed half.

## Borrowed — present in the code that was retired

These existed in `socialus-web` before the vendor deletion (#124) and are
recorded here because the code that held them is gone. They are observed, not
invented.

### The twelve retired categories

`groups.category` still carries these; the column loses its writer when the
category step goes. **Eight were live in `lib/categories.ts`:**

| Category | Emoji |
|---|---|
| Bread & Baked | 🍞 |
| Produce | 🥬 |
| Honey & Jams | 🍯 |
| Soap & Body | 🧼 |
| Candles | 🕯️ |
| Plants & Flowers | 🌸 |
| Crafts | 🎨 |
| Meat & Eggs | 🥚 |

**These are a farmers-market stall list, and that is the shape of the problem.**
They describe what someone sells at a Sunday market, not what a local enterprise
is. That narrowness is a large part of why the category step is being retired.

### The recruitment groupings, and their examples

From `RecruitmentGrid` — ten groupings with worked examples. The **groupings**
are the more useful half: they are how a person would sort local enterprise
before anyone imposed a schema.

| Grouping | Examples present in the code |
|---|---|
| Food Makers | Home Baker, Fermenter, Preserves & Honey Maker, Cooking or Baking Instructor |
| Growers | Eastside Urban Farm, Mushroom Grower, Backyard Orchardist, Native Plant Landscaper |
| Animal Products | Beekeeper, Small-Flock Egg Producer, Wool Producer |
| Home & Body Goods | Soap & Skincare Maker, Candlemaker |
| Textile & Fiber | Knitter or Crocheter, Sewing & Mending Teacher |
| Wood & Metal Makers | Furniture Maker, Jeweler, Leatherworker |
| Repair & Restoration | Shoe & Leather Repair, Watch & Clock Repair, Bicycle Mechanic |
| Traditional Trades | Independent Auto Mechanic |
| Teachers & Workshops | Fermentation Workshop |
| Local Service Providers | Independent House Cleaner |

### Ownership tiers

Six, from the retired `OwnershipTier` union, rendered as a dot plus a sentence:

| Tier | Sentence shown |
|---|---|
| `coop` | Worker or member owned |
| `independent` | Locally owned and operated |
| `mission-driven` | B Corp / Public Benefit Corporation |
| `local-franchise` | Locally owned franchise |
| `challenger` | Competing against market consolidation |
| `pe-corporate` | Private equity or corporate owned |

**This is a different axis from everything else on this page** — it describes
*who owns a thing*, not *what it does*, and it was the only one the retired UI
gave a coloured badge. `StatusDot` keeps the shape. Whether the platform
re-adopts the axis at all is unruled; the extractive tier in particular is a
judgement the platform would be making about a business, which is a heavier act
than a tag.

## What this is not, and what it might become

**Not a dropdown.** A creator writes their own word. If this list ever appears
in a composer as options, the ratified tag rule has been broken.

**Not an ordering.** `nouns.md` § Tag: *"Never — a tag that orders results."*

**Should it become a schema enum or a lookup table?** Probably a **table, and
not an enum** — but not yet, and not on this document's say-so.

- An **enum** is wrong: every addition is a migration, and this list is
  explicitly expected to grow from what creators write.
- A **lookup table** seeding the tag store is plausible — rows a creator's tag
  can match against for search, with no constraint that a tag must be in it.
  That is the shape `DECISIONS.md` already implies when it says the retired
  suggestion rows *"seed the initial tag list"*.

**Deciding that needs the tag store to exist**, which is blocked on
report-and-takedown (`nouns.md` § Tag, `[member-content-takedown]`). Recorded
here so the list is not lost; the schema question stays open.
