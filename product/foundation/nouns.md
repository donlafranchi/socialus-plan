purpose: The nouns — every entity the product has or will have, what each carries, what each deliberately does not. Spine document: every entry carries its own status and holds both horizons, what ships now and what is intended later.

# The nouns

> **Agent summary of [`model.md`](model.md), not a ruling. Cite the source or a `DECISIONS.md` line.** *(Marked 2026-09-15: this banner is where the Items drift came from — a paraphrase read as authority. Its claim that "there are no Items" is **disputed by Don and unsettled**; see [`../../planning/ITEMS-QUESTION.md`](../../planning/ITEMS-QUESTION.md).)* Where this document and `model.md` disagree, `model.md` is right — and neither this banner nor any summary of it settles anything.

One of two tracking documents, with `verbs.md` (what may be done to each noun). Together they're the model — what things *are*. `surfaces.md` is where things *show*. Keep the two apart; conflating them is how this project's worst failures happened (a surface decision — Sell as the only create door — silently became a model decision, because one document described both). Postponed nouns are listed here, labelled — leaving them out to keep the launch list clean is how the model stops describing the product.

**Status vocabulary**, used identically in `verbs.md`: **●** live (schema + working surface). **◐** substrate only (table exists, nothing reads/writes it). **○** postponed — ruled in, not scheduled. **✕** refused — deliberately absent, the reason is the entry.

**Two horizons on one entry:** `● now / ○ later` — what ships and what is intended. A concept lives in exactly one place, so the later horizon is a status here, never a second description in `IMAGINE.md` or anywhere else.

**Entry format.** One line when one line says it. When an entry has more to carry, it breaks into **labelled slots** — and the slot names are a closed set, which is what stops this file growing into prose again:

| Slot | Holds |
|---|---|
| **Now** | what ships today |
| **Later** | what it becomes, and why that is not an increment |
| **Blocked** | the specific thing standing in the way |
| **Trigger** | the observable fact that would move Later to Now |
| **Never** | what the entry deliberately excludes |

No other slot names. A thing that fits none of them is either detail for a systems doc or a line for `DECISIONS.md`.

## A vague term is never used by itself

**Don's ruling, 2026-09-15:** *"Item or kind or any other vague term is never to be used by itself."*

**Every term on the list below must be qualified at the point of use.** Not *kind* — **Page kind** or **entry type**. Not *item* — the specific sense, always. This binds docs, scenarios, tickets, commit messages, and any code identifier read as prose.

**The list is short on purpose.** A term earns a place by having caused drift here, or by meaning different things at different layers. Forty words is a list nobody follows.

| Term | Why it qualifies | Qualify as |
|---|---|---|
| **item** | Umbrella over seven unlike things, and the word needed for a product offered for sale. Don named it. | the specific type — Product, Service, Gathering, Idea, Offer, Ask, Initiative — or **entry** for the umbrella |
| **kind** | **Two vocabularies with the same column name**: `groups.kind` has six values, `items.kind` has seven, and they classify different layers. Don named it. | **Page kind** · **entry type** |
| **group** | **The `groups` table holds Pages**, while *Group* in product language means a social group. `verbs.md` records these as *"routinely blurred in older docs and different nouns with different rules."* | **social group** · **business Page** · **group membership** |
| **follower** | `F067`: *"Today 'follower' and 'member' mean the same thing in the code."* Same row, two meanings, diverging behaviour. | **Page follower** · **group member** |

**On the watch list, not yet binding:** *post* (a `page_posts` row versus the act the voice guide refuses), *state* (several columns, several meanings), and **event** — which now carries three senses: the **`event` Page kind** (a one-time gathering, ruled 2026-09-15), **a dated post** (`model.md`, F073), and **an event-log row** (`member_events`, `item_events`, `group_events`, `place_events`, and `item.published`). **The first two are the same idea at two layers and are fine; the third is unrelated and is the one to qualify — say *event-log row*, never a bare *event*.** **They are named here so the list can grow with evidence rather than with suspicion** — add one only when it has demonstrably drifted.

**Prose versus identifiers.** The rule binds **prose**. **It does not rename a schema column** — `groups.kind` stays `groups.kind`, and no check may fail the build on the existing schema. An identifier is exempt where it is an identifier and bound where it is read as prose: a commit message, a comment sentence, a ticket title.

**Where this is enforced:** § The user-facing string check, below. **Where it cannot be:** ordinary English. *"What kind of gathering"* and *"be kind"* are not violations, and no check can reliably tell them from the technical sense — which is why the bare-term check warns rather than fails outside a short list of certain cases.

## The spine

Three core nouns carry every loop: **Person, Item, Location.** A fourth — **social group** — exists for when a set of people decide they're an intentional, self-selected unit. Social groups are emergent and optional; no Member is ever auto-assigned to one. The grammar: people declare things · things attach to places · some people choose to be a social group · other people respond.

**Person** — a real human, one record per human. Holds verbs (makes, hosts, follows) rather than role-as-identity — a Person isn't *a Maker*, a Person *makes things*. Schema name `Member`. Detail: `../systems/member.md`.

**Item** — anything a Person declares: product, service, gathering, idea, offer, ask, initiative. One spine, varying by entry type (`items.kind`). **The word *Item* standing alone as an umbrella is what the rule above forbids; use the specific type.** Detail: `../systems/item.md`.

**Location** — a physical place (permanent, recurring-temporary, or area). No members of its own — for members, you need a social group. Detail: `../systems/location.md`.

**Social group** — a named, self-selected set of people. Six Page kinds: five affiliate (`place`, `interest`, `practice`, `event_anchored`, `family`) and one operate (`business`). Never auto-assigned by geography or anything else. Detail: `../systems/groups.md`.

## The two sides — patron and creator *(internal vocabulary)*

*(Ratified 2026-09-14, Don: "Creator and patron are shorthand for you and me when discussing the two sides broadly.")*

**These are our words for talking about the product, not the product's words for talking to a member.** A creator is someone who publishes something other people show up for — sells, hosts, organizes. A patron is everyone on the other side. Use them freely in these docs, in scenarios, in tickets, in conversation.

**Never rendered in a user-facing string.** *(Restores `role-language.md`'s rule: no person-noun in front of a member.)* Not in copy, not as a label under a name, not addressing a set of people. A member is addressed as **you**; a set of people is **people**, or named. Everything a person *does* is a verb — make, sell, host, offer, ask, wonder, show up, back, follow, save.

**What was actually overruled** on 2026-09-14 is narrow: the old doc refused to let *us* name the two sides at all, even internally. That refusal is gone. **Its user-facing rule stands unchanged.**

**Neither is a stored type.** Patron is the default state of being a member, not a column; creator derives from the attestation record plus what the person has authored. The pair is vocabulary, not schema — see the `Member` row's "no type, tier, or stored role," which is unchanged by this ruling.

### The user-facing string check — because prose rules have not held

*(2026-09-14, extended 2026-09-15 with the mechanical rules from `voice.md`. Twice a naming ruling has been written wider than Don made it. `LESSONS.md` 17: a rule with no hook is a wish.)*

**Scope, for every rule below:** user-facing strings in `socialus-web` — JSX text nodes, and string literals reaching a rendered prop (`label`, `title`, `placeholder`, `alt`, `aria-label`, `children`). **Never** identifiers, table and column names, routes, imports, comments, test fixtures, or these planning docs. The rule is about what a member reads, not what the code calls things.

**Fails the build:**

| Check | What it catches | From |
|---|---|---|
| **Person-noun** | `vendor · producer · seller · maker · supporter · consumer · patron · creator` as a whole word | this document |
| **Em dash** | any `—` character at all | `voice.md` § Writing mechanics — "No em dashes, anywhere" |
| **"Corner"** | `corner` as a whole word | `voice.md` — reads as forced |
| **Corporate transitions** | `moreover · furthermore · additionally · essentially · in a world where` | `voice.md` |
| **Bare vague term, certain cases** | `item` / `items` as an umbrella, and `kind` immediately followed by a noun it does not qualify, in **docs and prose only — never in schema identifiers** | § A vague term is never used by itself |

**Warns, needs a human look — the pattern is real but the false-positive rate is not zero:**

| Check | What it catches | Why not a hard fail |
|---|---|---|
| **"not just X, but Y"** | `not just` within 60 characters of `but` | Don bans it *as a repeated tic*, not per instance. His own name-sharing line uses it once. |
| **Posting language** | `post · posting · share · sharing` as a verb about a member's own listing | "Share this link" is legitimate; "share a photo" is the failure. Only a reader can tell. |
| **Bare vague term, general** | Any of `item · kind · group · follower` in prose with no approved qualifier nearby | **Ordinary English is indistinguishable from the technical sense.** *"What kind of gathering"* must not fail a build. |

**Not checkable, and recorded as prose so nobody pretends otherwise:** no forced rule of three · CTAs point outward not inward · tone is warm and plainspoken · state things as fact not promise · no release numbers or internal jargon · no named-competitor comparison · real nouns over abstractions. **These live in `voice.md` and are enforced by reading, not by CI.** Saying so is the point — a rule filed as testable that no test holds is how the person-noun rule went unenforced twice.

**Escape hatch:** a line comment naming the dated `DECISIONS.md` ruling that permits it. No ruling, no exception — that is the whole point of moving this out of prose.

**Never** — a person-noun in any user-facing string, these two included. A third internal person-noun without a dated ruling. Producer, seller, maker, vendor, supporter and consumer as anything but spec words; "vendor" was removed from the product once already and is still in the code. Functional words — owner, staff, steward, host, founder — outside the scope of one Page or one gathering; they never become a profile-level identity.

## Page — the canonical definition

*(Ratified 2026-09-07. The UI name for a `groups` row — the line every other doc is checked against.)*

**A Page is the person or people behind the listing. Page is *who*; Item is *what*.** A Page holds many Items and dates over time and carries identity, a name, a face, followers.

**Amended 2026-09-15, Don's direct ruling: every kind gets a Page, including a one-time gathering.** *"We can create a page for every kind. It just doesn't require all of the same tools."* What differs between kinds is the tools the Page offers, never whether it is a Page. **This overrules the earlier "no Page for a single occasion"**, whose reasoning — that browse and the map would index listings as if they were people, and a follower graph on something ephemeral is worthless — is answered by the tools differing rather than the entity differing. **The `Page is who; Item is what` framing above is disputed and unresolved; see `planning/ITEMS-QUESTION.md`. It is not retired.** Pages have varying lifespans and are created sequentially, never simultaneously — a producer who also hosts makes a second Page, never converts the first. A Page may sell, host, or both, and needs no business record to do either — the business record is a claim about the Page, not a permission.

**Three consequences:** the map's unit is the Page, not the thing filed under it — search sourdough and see the bakers, not individual loaves. One Page is one place — a two-location bakery is two Pages, which is why the map needs no cross-location grouping. A Page with no fixed place is found through the Venues it appears at, never pinned at an address it doesn't have. Anything in the past doesn't appear — time-based, automatic, no manual cleanup.

**A Page's address is public if given** *(ratified 2026-09-09)* — a street address if it has a specific location, a neighbourhood otherwise; having premises decides it, not the Page kind. It's a public location, not a private one — the platform won't stop someone entering a home address, but it's shown to anyone who views the Page. The field must say so before anyone types into it.

**A residence's address is public too, at launch** *(Don, 2026-09-30)*. The protection is the option to give a neighbourhood instead of a street. **Revisit** withholding a residence address from anyone not invited or responding once RSVPs (F063) and a residence flag exist. The answering layer inherits whatever the Page surface holds.

## The nouns that ship

| Noun | Status | What it is | **What it deliberately does not have** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Member** | ● | One real human, one account | No type, tier, or stored role. No platform-awarded badge, rating, or label it didn't write itself. |
| **Page** | ● | The person or people behind the listing | No permanent Page kind that gates anything. No permission granted by its business record. No conversion into another Page. **Its owner picks one or more collections from a curated set of about ten** *(2026-09-19 — reverses the 2026-09-13 "no category a creator picks"; a collection is platform vocabulary the owner selects from, not a second vocabulary they author)*. Overlapping, not exclusive. No collection a creator invents. |
| **Item** *(umbrella — qualify at use)* | ● | One thing offered, or one occasion | No independent existence off a Page. No response counter shown to its author. No date on a product. |
| ~~**Venue**~~ | ✕ | **Not a noun** *(2026-09-12)* — a venue is an organization hosting at a Location. The Page is justified by what the organization is; persistence is `locations.kind` (Harlow's `permanent`, a Saturday market `recurring_temporary`). | No entity of its own, and no Page kind. Anything can host — a bakery running a book club is a venue that evening, on the one Page it already had. |
| **Place** | ● | Platform-curated geography (neighbourhood → state) | No member-facing create surface. Nobody adds a Place. |

## The nouns that are coming — ruled in, not all scheduled

- **Response** `● now / ○ later` *(2026-09-12)* — a member says they are coming to an occurrence.
  - **Now** — a thumbs up or nothing. Presence or absence of a row, not a state column. The organizer sees two lists; names are shown; the public sees the count.
  - **Later** — four states: coming · not coming · seen and undecided · declined. A state column replacing a row's existence — a migration and a rewrite of every read, **not an increment**.
  - **Blocked** — `members.avatar_url` has no write path. The list shows faces; no member has one.
  - **Trigger** — an organizer saying the yes-list alone isn't enough to plan with.
  - **Later** — **confirmed by the organiser**, which makes a response an interaction for F077 *(2026-09-30)*.
- **Tag** ● *(2026-09-12, made the only vocabulary 2026-09-13; status corrected to live 2026-09-19)* — a creator's own word for what their Page is. **Created, not picked from a fixed list, and public.**
  - **Now** — **shipped.** `tags` and `page_tags` exist and are written by `group.activate`; `browse_feed` matches a lens on `tags.normalized` and excludes any tag whose `status` is not `visible`, so a tag taken down stops steering discovery rather than merely disappearing from display. **The only vocabulary a creator authors, and the only thing search matches.**
  - **Later** — editing tags on a live Page. **Written once, at activation** — there is no tag editing after that.
  - **Blocked** — nothing. The old blocker was report-and-takedown, and it **shipped**: `reports`, `report_decisions` and a reviewing surface are on main.
  - **Never** — a tag that orders results, or one the platform assigns. *(The third Never — "a coarse category a creator picks alongside it" — was reversed 2026-09-19. **Collections are exactly that**, and the line is struck rather than reworded so nobody cites it. What survives it: tags stay the only vocabulary a **creator authors**, and the only thing search matches; a collection is a name the platform owns.)*
- **Announcement** ● *(status corrected to live 2026-09-19; named the only word 2026-09-21)* — a Page says what is on. **One noun, one word, everywhere** — in the model, the docs and the product, with no creator-facing synonym and no per-kind vocabulary. **Its audience is a field on it, not a second noun**: public, or only people who get updates. **The post appears in browse** *(ruled 2026-09-12 — flat, not only the dated ones)*. Table is `page_posts`, not `bulletins` (2026-09-09) — the Page is the board, an announcement is the first kind of post. **Editable after posting** *(ruled 2026-09-13 — reverses the earlier no-edit rule)*; **delete still refused**; no inbox, no unread state.
  - **Now** — **shipped.** `page_posts` exists, `group.post_create` and `group.post_edit` write it, and `browse_feed` returns posts and Pages in one result set. **`group_id` is `NOT NULL`** — a post has no existence apart from its Page, which is what lets one query return both without inventing a second identity for the poster.
  - **Later** — a date, a time and its own address on a post (F072), and a series that repeats (F074, unruled). **`ends_at` does not exist** on the table; `starts_at` does, as `timestamptz`, indexed.
- **Purchase** ○ *(2026-09-30)* — a member bought something from a business Page, confirmed by the seller, dated, with both members on it. **Not tracked yet; parked.** F077's sale half waits on it. Only the business's owners see who bought.
- **Discussion message** ○ — a reply on a Page's board, one level deep (not a tree). Member-authored top-level posts are a later increment and need an operator concept that doesn't exist yet.
- **Direct message** ○ — one person to another. No substrate exists at all. Never Location-scoped — the accountable-participation commitment is honoured by absence.
- **Idea** `○` *(schema `wonder`)* — someone puts a new thing to the neighbourhood and others signal interest before it exists.
  - **Never** — an expiry, or any conversion into another entry type *(2026-09-15, Don)*. The author creates the new Page themselves and announces or links it from the wonder.
  - **Now** — substrate only.
  - **Blocked** — the signalling / threshold / conversion mechanic is undesigned.
  - *The most distinctive thing in the positioning, and the hardest deferral on the list.*
- **Volunteering** `○` *(schema `offer`/`ask`)* — offering help, or asking for it.
  - **Now** — entry types exist, no composer.
  - **Blocked** — the missing reply channel, not the composer.
- **Appearance** ○ — a Page at a Venue for a bounded time. Cannot overlap in time, refused at creation.
- **Operator** `● now / ○ later` *(status corrected 2026-09-19 — the old line said "nothing exists yet" and three things do)* — whoever can remove someone else's content.
  - **Now** — **a check, and only a check.** `src/actions/_lib/operator.ts` compares the acting member against one env var, `OPERATOR_MEMBER_ID`, and **unset means nobody** — it fails closed, because the failure mode of the alternative is the whole moderation surface open to the internet. `reports`, `report_decisions` and the reviewing surface are on main; a decision is a reversible event.
  - **Later** — delegated reviewers, which is more than one operator and therefore a real identity rather than an env var.
  - **Never** — an operator role stored on a member. **There is still no roles table and no flag** — that part of the old line was right and survives. The singular, definite "the operator" in F058 is what the env var encodes.
- **Poll** ○ — `page_posts.kind='poll'` + `page_post_options`. Deliberately separate substrate from demand signals: a poll option is a row with a foreign key; a demand signal's subject has none, by design.

## Refused, and why

| Not a noun | Why |
|---|---|
| **Business entity** ✕ | No corporate shell between Persons and what they declare — every entry has a named human accountable for it. When a feature seems to want a corporate row: attach it to the Member or the business Group, never a shell. |
| **Role** ✕ | Roles are verbs a Member is doing, surfaced from activity. The moment a `role` enum lands on `members`, the primitive collapses into a directory-of-types. |
| **Follow on a product or service** ✕ | Ruled 2026-09-07 — people don't follow products. Removed as a concept, not deferred. |
| **Location-scoped messaging or feed** ✕ | No surface addresses everyone in a place — accountable participation, honoured by absence. |
| **Bulletin** ✕ | **A delivery mode, not a thing** *(2026-09-21, Don)*. It named one setting of an announcement's audience field — the addressed-and-pushed half — and an announcement is one noun whatever its audience. **Never a noun, an object type, or a label**, and never a creator-facing word: *Announcement* is the word everywhere, in the model, the docs and the product. Distinct from the six rejected role words, which are relations mistaken for things; this is a mode mistaken for one. The only thing ever built under the word is the retired `/you/vendor/bulletins` screen, which tracked *delivered / opened / clicked* — what `metrics.md` refuses. |
| **Cooperative governance** ✕ | Voting and distributions are off-platform verbs (securities law, operating agreements). A business Group with multiple owner-role memberships carries the cooperative *shape* without claiming to answer whether a vote is legally binding. |

**Why no Business entity, concretely:** the closest construct is a `kind='business'` Page — itself a group of Members, not a corporate record. Maya doesn't *have* a business; she's the sole owner-role member of a business Page, and what she files belongs to her. "Business name" on any surface is a business-Page label, not a separate record. This keeps the platform people-first structurally, not rhetorically, and makes cooperative formation a first-class outcome rather than a new entity type. Test for future proposals: does this give a business Page ownership of what is filed under it, or of other Pages, even indirectly? If yes, refuse.

## Who sees what

**The one place for visibility between people.** Filled from the rulings, 2026-09-30 winning; every cell with no ruling behind it is a lettered question below. `verbs.md` and `policy.md` point here.

**Viewers.** *Signed out* — the general public. *Stranger* — signed in, no relation to the Page. *Follower* and *member* of the Page (a member gets everything a follower does, 2026-09-29). *Consumer* — RSVP'd to or bought from the Page, and neither follower nor member. *Runner* — the Page's creator, owner or steward.

● sees · ✕ not currently · ◐ partly, as noted · — cannot arise · **(x)** open, below

**Where each cell comes from.** Member fields and interest tags: nobody reads anything about a member, only what they post; a creator may show their own display name and avatar on their Page (2026-09-30). Front door and contents: private, community-only and public are group-Page levels for signed-in members; business Pages take none; a signed-out visitor gets the front door and nothing for a private group (2026-09-30); a private Page has members, not followers (2026-09-15). Roster: a stranger doesn't see it (2026-09-30); current members see each other (2026-09-08). Follow graph: nobody sees who follows whom, and a runner sees who follows their Page (2026-09-30). RSVPs and purchases: group members see who RSVP'd; only a business's owners see who bought (2026-09-30); the count is the Response entry above. Legal name: **we currently show it to no member**; it is collected for the platform's protection and seen only by Don and operators, and real names between people who dealt with each other are out of scope until counsel (F077, 2026-09-30). Announcements: the public/followers switch (2026-09-21), no third audience (2026-09-30), the signed-out card (F093). Don and operators see what the platform collects for its protection (2026-09-30), outside this table.

**Combinations** are the open question (h). Someone who runs one Page is a stranger to another. Visibility between creators and consumers as people, not through a Page, is parked (i).

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(a)** Does a signed-in stranger see a private group Page's front door, so they can find it and ask to join? A) **Yes, the front door only:** the Page decides whether membership needs approval (2026-09-29), and nobody can ask to join a Page they cannot find. B) No: a private Page is invisible to non-members. *Recommend A.*

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(b)** Does a consumer — someone who RSVP'd or bought, and is neither follower nor member — see anything a signed-in stranger does not, beyond their own RSVP or purchase? A) **No.** Taking part once does not make someone involved. B) Yes: the other people who RSVP'd to the same thing. *Recommend A;* involvement is membership, and joining is one tap.

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(c)** What does "community-members-only" mean: the Page's own members, or every signed-in SocialUs member? A) **Every signed-in member:** a Page open to the community and closed to the internet, distinct from private. B) The Page's members only, which makes it private in all but whether the front door is findable. *Recommend A,* because B leaves two levels that differ only in the front door.

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(d)** Who sees who RSVP'd to a business Page's gathering? The 2026-09-30 ruling names group members. A) **The business's owners only**, like who bought. B) Its members too, as on a group Page. *Recommend A.*

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(e)** What is on a Page's front door for someone signed out, besides its name, photo and where it shows up — an RSVP count, upcoming dates, its tags? A) **Name, photo, where, tags, and F093's withheld announcement card; no counts or dates.** B) Also the RSVP count. *Recommend A:* the front door says what the thing is, and joining says what is on.

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(f)** Does a Page's front door show its founder or seller? Two same-day answers conflict: *"Is a founder or seller part of the front door? Yes, by display name"* and *"May a stranger see a Page's roster or founder? No."* A) **Yes, by display name**, and the "no" was about the roster: a stranger sees who runs the thing, not who belongs to it. B) Not to a stranger; the creator may still choose to show a display name and avatar. *Recommend A.* Nothing that shows a founder to a non-member is built until this is answered.

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(g)** Does a public announcement on a community-only or private group Page reach people who cannot see the Page's contents? A) **Yes:** public is public, which is what it is for (*come join our run club*, 2026-09-21). B) No: the Page's level caps its announcements. *Recommend A.*

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(h)** A viewer holding two relations — a follower who bought, a member who RSVP'd, a runner who follows another Page — sees what? A) **The union of their columns, and nothing more.** B) Something a combination unlocks on its own, e.g. a follower who bought sees other buyers. *Recommend A;* it adds no new cell to rule on.

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(i)** Visibility between people directly — creator and consumer, creator and creator, consumer and consumer — and a consumer's own visibility setting, which comes with direct messaging. **Parked by Don 2026-09-30, not launch.** Marked so it stays in the index. `stakeholder_visibility` is the creator's setting today.

### Nouns this needs

- **Consumer.** Don's word on 2026-09-30 for the other side from Page creators. [open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-30] **(j)** Is "consumer" a new internal word for what this file calls patron — everyone who is not publishing — or the narrower sense this table uses, someone who RSVP'd or bought? A) **The narrow sense, derived from a confirmed RSVP or purchase and not stored**, beside patron. B) A rename of patron. *Recommend A;* patron already names the broad side, and a third person-noun needs a dated ruling either way. Internal only: not a user-facing word.
- **Purchase** — ○ below: a confirmed purchase is not tracked yet.
- **Confirmed interaction** — a Response confirmed by the organiser, or a Purchase confirmed by the seller, dated, with both members on it (F077, out of scope for now). A state on those two nouns, not a noun of its own.
- **A Page's visibility level** — a field on a group Page, not a noun. It sits on members today and moves (`socialus-web` #246).

## The relationships

**Retired as prose, 2026-09-19. The link model lives in one place and this is not it:** `src/ontology/links.ts` in `socialus-web`, generated to `src/ontology/registry.json` (schema 2) and checked against the handlers by `scripts/ontology-drift.ts`, which runs daily.

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-16] Which noun does the paused ontology spike model first — Item or Page? The spike lives outside this repo, at `../socialus-ontology-spike/INTENT.md`.

**Why the paragraph that stood here is gone rather than corrected.** It was the second description of the link model and the one people read to be right, while **nothing checked it** — the failure this repo is named for. It had already drifted: it listed *"Person↔Page: founder/steward/owner/member of"* as one relation, and those are **two links with different meanings**. Ownership is `groups.founder_member_id` — who *started* the Page, which **no permission consults**. Authority is `group_memberships.role` — `owner` or `steward`, which is what every managing check actually reads. They coincide today only because one handler writes both, and **a steward who did not found a Page holds authority under the second and appears under neither of the others**. That link was undeclared until 2026-09-19.

**What to read instead, by question:**

| Question | Where |
|---|---|
| Which relationships are declared, and which are declared-but-unbuilt | `registry.json` → `links`, each with its table, column, writing handlers and `built` flag |
| Which handler writes a given link | that link's `writtenBy` |
| Whether the declaration still matches the code | `scripts/ontology-drift.ts`, daily; its verdict is reported in `STATUS.md`, not re-derived here |
| The shape of the registry at a glance | `STATUS.md` § The ontology — what is declared |

**What stays here, because it is a refusal and not a link:** **the relationship surface is intentionally flat.** There is no Business that owns entries at a Location and employs Persons — see § Refused, and why. A registry can say what exists; only this file says what may never be added.
