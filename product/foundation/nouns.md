purpose: The nouns — every entity the product has or will have, what each carries, what each deliberately does not. Spine document: every entry carries its own status and holds both horizons, what ships now and what is intended later. The future version of a noun is a status on its entry here, never a second description elsewhere.

# The nouns

> **Agent summary of [`model.md`](model.md), not a ruling. Cite the source or a `DECISIONS.md` line.** *(Marked 2026-09-15: this banner is where the Items drift came from — a paraphrase read as authority. Its claim that "there are no Items" is **disputed by Don and unsettled**; see [`../../planning/ITEMS-QUESTION.md`](../../planning/ITEMS-QUESTION.md).)* Where this document and `model.md` disagree, `model.md` is right — and neither this banner nor any summary of it settles anything.

One of two tracking documents, with `verbs.md` (what may be done to each noun). Together they're the model — what things *are*. `surfaces.md` is where things *show*. Keep the two apart; conflating them is how this project's worst failures happened (a surface decision — Sell as the only create door — silently became a model decision, because one document described both). Postponed nouns are listed here, labelled — leaving them out to keep the launch list clean is how the model stops describing the product.

**Status vocabulary**, used identically in `verbs.md`: **●** live (schema + working surface). **◐** substrate only (table exists, nothing reads/writes it). **○** postponed — ruled in, not scheduled. **✕** refused — deliberately absent, the reason is the entry.

**Two horizons on one entry:** `● now / ○ later` — what ships and what is intended. A concept lives in exactly one place, so the later horizon is a status here, never a second description in `IMAGINE.md` or anywhere else.

**Entry format.** One line when one line says it. When an entry has more to carry, it breaks into **labelled slots** — and the slot names are a closed set, which is what stops this file growing into prose again:

| Slot | Holds |
|---|---|
| **Now** | what ships today |
| **Later** | what it becomes, and why that is not an increment |
| **Blocked** | the specific thing standing in the way |
| **Trigger** | the observable fact that would move Later to Now |
| **Never** | what the entry deliberately excludes |

No other slot names. A thing that fits none of them is either detail for a systems doc or a line for `DECISIONS.md`.

## A vague term is never used by itself

**Don's ruling, 2026-09-15:** *"Item or kind or any other vague term is never to be used by itself."*

**Every term on the list below must be qualified at the point of use.** Not *kind* — **Page kind** or **entry type**. Not *item* — the specific sense, always. This binds docs, scenarios, tickets, commit messages, and any code identifier read as prose.

**The list is short on purpose.** A term earns a place by having caused drift here, or by meaning different things at different layers. Forty words is a list nobody follows.

| Term | Why it qualifies | Qualify as |
|---|---|---|
| **item** | Umbrella over seven unlike things, and the word needed for a product offered for sale. Don named it. | the specific type — Product, Service, Gathering, Idea, Offer, Ask, Initiative — or **entry** for the umbrella |
| **kind** | **Two vocabularies with the same column name**: `groups.kind` has six values, `items.kind` has seven, and they classify different layers. Don named it. | **Page kind** · **entry type** |
| **group** | **The `groups` table holds Pages**, while *Group* in product language means a social group. `verbs.md` records these as *"routinely blurred in older docs and different nouns with different rules."* | **social group** · **business Page** · **group membership** |
| **follower** | `F067`: *"Today 'follower' and 'member' mean the same thing in the code."* Same row, two meanings, diverging behaviour. | **Page follower** · **group member** |

**On the watch list, not yet binding:** *post* (a `page_posts` row versus the act the voice guide refuses), *state* (several columns, several meanings), and **event** — which carries two senses: **a dated post** (`model.md`, F073) — the only kind of event a Page has (2026-10-01) — and **an event-log row** (`member_events`, `item_events`, `group_events`, `place_events`, and `item.published`). **The first is fine; the second is unrelated and is the one to qualify — say *event-log row*, not a bare *event*.** **They are named here so the list can grow with evidence rather than with suspicion** — add one only when it has demonstrably drifted.

**Prose versus identifiers.** The rule binds **prose**. **It does not rename a schema column** — `groups.kind` stays `groups.kind`, and no check may fail the build on the existing schema. An identifier is exempt where it is an identifier and bound where it is read as prose: a commit message, a comment sentence, a ticket title.

**Where this is enforced:** § The user-facing string check, below. **Where it cannot be:** ordinary English. *"What kind of gathering"* and *"be kind"* are not violations, and no check can reliably tell them from the technical sense — which is why the bare-term check warns rather than fails outside a short list of certain cases.

## The spine

Three core nouns carry every loop: **Person, Item, Location.** A fourth — **social group** — exists for when a set of people decide they're an intentional, self-selected unit. Social groups are emergent and optional; no Member is ever auto-assigned to one. The grammar: people declare things · things attach to places · some people choose to be a social group · other people respond.

**Person** — a real human, one record per human. Holds verbs (makes, hosts, follows) rather than role-as-identity — a Person isn't *a Maker*, a Person *makes things*. Schema name `Member`. Detail: `../systems/member.md`.

**Item** — anything a Person declares: product, service, gathering, idea, offer, ask, initiative. One spine, varying by entry type (`items.kind`). **The word *Item* standing alone as an umbrella is what the rule above forbids; use the specific type.** Detail: `../systems/item.md`.

**Location** — a physical place (permanent, recurring-temporary, or area). No members of its own — for members, you need a social group. Detail: `../systems/location.md`.

**Social group** — a named, self-selected set of people. Six Page kinds: five affiliate (`place`, `interest`, `practice`, `event_anchored`, `family`) and one operate (`business`). Never auto-assigned by geography or anything else. Detail: `../systems/groups.md`.

## The two sides — patron and creator *(internal vocabulary)*

*(Ratified 2026-09-14, Don: "Creator and patron are shorthand for you and me when discussing the two sides broadly.")*

**These are our words for talking about the product, not the product's words for talking to a member.** A creator is someone who publishes something other people show up for — sells, hosts, organizes. A patron is everyone on the other side. Use them freely in these docs, in scenarios, in tickets, in conversation.

**Never rendered in a user-facing string.** *(Restores `role-language.md`'s rule: no person-noun in front of a member.)* Not in copy, not as a label under a name, not addressing a set of people. A member is addressed as **you**; a set of people is **people**, or named. Everything a person *does* is a verb — make, sell, host, offer, ask, wonder, show up, back, follow, save.

**What was actually overruled** on 2026-09-14 is narrow: the old doc refused to let *us* name the two sides at all, even internally. That refusal is gone. **Its user-facing rule stands unchanged.**

**Neither is a stored type.** Patron is the default state of being a member, not a column; creator derives from the attestation record plus what the person has authored. The pair is vocabulary, not schema — see the `Member` row's "no type, tier, or stored role," which is unchanged by this ruling.

### The user-facing string check — because prose rules have not held

*(2026-09-14, extended 2026-09-15 with the mechanical rules from `voice.md`. Twice a naming ruling has been written wider than Don made it. `ops-pattern/process/LESSONS.md` 17: a rule with no hook is a wish.)*

**Scope, for every rule below:** user-facing strings in `socialus-web` — JSX text nodes, and string literals reaching a rendered prop (`label`, `title`, `placeholder`, `alt`, `aria-label`, `children`). **Never** identifiers, table and column names, routes, imports, comments, test fixtures, or these planning docs. The rule is about what a member reads, not what the code calls things.

**Fails the build:**

| Check | What it catches | From |
|---|---|---|
| **Person-noun** | `vendor · producer · seller · maker · supporter · consumer · patron · creator` as a whole word | this document |
| **Em dash** | any `—` character at all | `voice.md` § Writing mechanics — "No em dashes, anywhere" |
| **"Corner"** | `corner` as a whole word | `voice.md` — reads as forced |
| **Corporate transitions** | `moreover · furthermore · additionally · essentially · in a world where` | `voice.md` |
| **Bare vague term, certain cases** | `item` / `items` as an umbrella, and `kind` immediately followed by a noun it does not qualify, in **docs and prose only — never in schema identifiers** | § A vague term is never used by itself |

**Warns, needs a human look — the pattern is real but the false-positive rate is not zero:**

| Check | What it catches | Why not a hard fail |
|---|---|---|
| **"not just X, but Y"** | `not just` within 60 characters of `but` | Don bans it *as a repeated tic*, not per instance. His own name-sharing line uses it once. |
| **Posting language** | `post · posting · share · sharing` as a verb about a member's own listing | "Share this link" is legitimate; "share a photo" is the failure. Only a reader can tell. |
| **Bare vague term, general** | Any of `item · kind · group · follower` in prose with no approved qualifier nearby | **Ordinary English is indistinguishable from the technical sense.** *"What kind of gathering"* must not fail a build. |

**Not checkable, and recorded as prose so nobody pretends otherwise:** no forced rule of three · CTAs point outward not inward · tone is warm and plainspoken · state things as fact not promise · no release numbers or internal jargon · no named-competitor comparison · real nouns over abstractions. **These live in `voice.md` and are enforced by reading, not by CI.** Saying so is the point — a rule filed as testable that no test holds is how the person-noun rule went unenforced twice.

**Escape hatch:** a line comment naming the dated `DECISIONS.md` ruling that permits it. No ruling, no exception — that is the whole point of moving this out of prose.

**Never** — a person-noun in any user-facing string, these two included. A third internal person-noun without a dated ruling. Producer, seller, maker, vendor, supporter and consumer as anything but spec words; "vendor" was removed from the product once already and is still in the code. Functional words — owner, staff, steward, host, founder — outside the scope of one Page or one gathering; they never become a profile-level identity.

## Page — the canonical definition

*(Ratified 2026-09-07. The UI name for a `groups` row — the line every other doc is checked against.)*

**A Page is an organization: a group, a business, or another organization** — in Don's words, *"an organizing entity for something that needs more than one of anything"* (2026-09-12, `model.md`). It holds many posts over time and carries identity, a name, a face, followers.

The launch is a yellow pages of organizations, not a white pages of people (2026-10-01). What differs between kinds is the tools the Page offers, not whether it is a Page (2026-09-15). Pages have varying lifespans and are created one at a time, not simultaneously — a producer who also hosts makes a second Page and doesn't convert the first. A Page may sell, host, or both, and needs no business record to do either — the business record is a claim about the Page, not a permission.

**Three consequences:** the map's unit is the Page, not the thing filed under it — search sourdough and see the bakers, not individual loaves. One Page is one place — a two-location bakery is two Pages, which is why the map needs no cross-location grouping. A Page with no fixed place is found through the Venues it appears at, never pinned at an address it doesn't have. Anything in the past doesn't appear — time-based, automatic, no manual cleanup.

**A Page's address is public if given** *(ratified 2026-09-09)* — a street address if it has a specific location, a neighbourhood otherwise; having premises decides it, not the Page kind. It's a public location, not a private one — the platform won't stop someone entering a home address, but it's shown to anyone who views the Page. The field must say so before anyone types into it.

**A residence's address is public too, at launch** *(Don, 2026-09-30)*. The protection is the option to give a neighbourhood instead of a street. **Revisit** withholding a residence address from anyone not invited or responding once RSVPs (F063) and a residence flag exist. The answering layer inherits whatever the Page surface holds.

### Page, post and event — how the words relate *(Don, 2026-10-01)*

- **Page** is the platform noun for an organization. **Group, business and organization** are the everyday words for kinds of Page, not separate things: a business Page, a social group's Page, an organization's Page. The `groups` table holds all of them.
- **Post** is something a Page publishes (`page_posts`). **An announcement is a kind of post, and so is an event** — a post with a time.
- **An organization holds events; an event is not an organization.** There is currently no event Page: a once-a-year event like BottleRock is still an organization's event. An event without an organization waits in `ROADMAP.md` § Later, speculative.
- **Which words show.** User-facing: **Page**, and **"Event"** for a post with a time (2026-09-30). Internal: **gathering** (a post or entry kind for something people come back to), **meetup** (an everyday word, not a label), **occasion** (withdrawn). **Shop, service and group** name kinds or presets of Page, shown at creation with what each is for (placeholder copy, [public-is-draft]); business and social are presets, not rules (2026-09-30).

## The nouns that ship

| Noun | Status | What it is | **What it deliberately does not have** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Member** | ● | One real human, one account | No type, tier, or stored role. No platform-awarded badge, rating, or label it didn't write itself. **No public profile** *(2026-10-01)*: **You** is private, for managing your own things — the Pages you manage, the Pages you follow, your zip and metro — and currently isn't visible to anyone else. Someone who wants to be followed, such as an artist, creates a Page. |
| **Page** | ● | An organization: a group, a business, or another organization | No permanent Page kind that gates anything. No permission granted by its business record. No conversion into another Page. **Its owner picks one or more collections from a curated set of about ten** *(2026-09-19 — reverses the 2026-09-13 "no category a creator picks"; a collection is platform vocabulary the owner selects from, not a second vocabulary they author)*. Overlapping, not exclusive. No collection a creator invents. |
| **Item** *(umbrella — qualify at use)* | ● | One thing offered, or one occasion | No independent existence off a Page. No response counter shown to its author. No date on a product. |
| ~~**Venue**~~ | ✕ | **Not a noun** *(2026-09-12)* — a venue is an organization hosting at a Location. The Page is justified by what the organization is; persistence is `locations.kind` (Harlow's `permanent`, a Saturday market `recurring_temporary`). | No entity of its own, and no Page kind. Anything can host — a bakery running a book club is a venue that evening, on the one Page it already had. |
| **Place** | ● | Platform-curated geography (neighbourhood → state) | No member-facing create surface. Nobody adds a Place. |

## The nouns that are coming — ruled in, not all scheduled

- **Response** `● now / ○ later` *(2026-09-12)* — a member says they are coming to an occurrence.
  - **Now** — a thumbs up or nothing. Presence or absence of a row, not a state column. The organizer sees two lists; names are shown; the public sees the count.
  - **Later** — four states: coming · not coming · seen and undecided · declined. A state column replacing a row's existence — a migration and a rewrite of every read, **not an increment**.
  - **Blocked** — `members.avatar_url` has no write path. The list shows faces; no member has one.
  - **Trigger** — an organizer saying the yes-list alone isn't enough to plan with.
  - **Later** — **confirmed by the organiser**, which makes a response an interaction for F077 *(2026-09-30)*.
- **Tag** ● *(2026-09-12, made the only vocabulary 2026-09-13; status corrected to live 2026-09-19)* — a creator's own word for what their Page is. **Created, not picked from a fixed list, and public.** **Values tags are not Tags** — they are kept separately, see Value *(2026-10-01)*.
  - **Now** — **shipped.** `tags` and `page_tags` exist and are written by `group.activate`; `browse_feed` matches a lens on `tags.normalized` and excludes any tag whose `status` is not `visible`, so a tag taken down stops steering discovery rather than merely disappearing from display. **The only vocabulary a creator authors, and the only thing search matches.**
  - **Later** — **tags on posts, and editing tags at any time, forever** *(2026-10-01)*; today they are written once, at activation. **Moderated after they appear**, against a list marking each tag safe, unsafe or needs review *(2026-10-01)*.
  - **Blocked** — nothing. The old blocker was report-and-takedown, and it **shipped**: `reports`, `report_decisions` and a reviewing surface are on main.
  - **Currently** — **tags decide what matches, not who comes first:** nobody gets a higher place by adding, buying or stuffing tags; order comes from the ordering rule (`product/ui/surfaces.md`). *(Rewritten 2026-10-01 at Don's request; it was a "never".)* **Never** — a tag the platform assigns. *(The third Never — "a coarse category a creator picks alongside it" — was reversed 2026-09-19. **Collections are exactly that**, and the line is struck rather than reworded so nobody cites it. What survives it: tags stay the only vocabulary a **creator authors**, and the only thing search matches; a collection is a name the platform owns.)*
- **Post** ● *(the noun from 2026-10-01; announcement was the word 2026-09-21 to 2026-10-01)* — what a Page says to its metro: a card in Explore, the vehicle from a Page to the area. Table is `page_posts`. **Its kind is a field** — announcement first, then gathering, poll and others — **and its audience is a field**: public, or only people who get updates. **Appears in browse** *(2026-09-12)*. **Editable after posting** *(2026-09-13)*; **delete still refused**; no inbox, no unread state. Tags of its own *(2026-10-01)*, see Tag.
  - **Lifespan** *(Don, 2026-10-02)* — a post with no event date leaves Explore after 14 days and moves to an "Earlier" section on its Page; the owner can set an optional "show until" date. Every undated post shows "Posted <date>".
  - **Now** — **shipped.** `page_posts` exists, `group.post_create` and `group.post_edit` write it, and `browse_feed` returns posts and Pages in one result set. **`group_id` is `NOT NULL`** — a post has no existence apart from its Page.
  - **Later** — a date, a time and its own address on a post (F072), a series that repeats (F074). **`ends_at` does not exist** yet; an optional end time is ruled (2026-09-30, F072 criterion 6); `starts_at` does, as `timestamptz`, indexed. User-facing *announcement* copy reviewed for *post* ([public-is-draft]).
- **Announcement** ● — **a kind of Post, the first one.** See Post.
- **Value** ○ *(2026-10-01)* — what a member, or a Page owner, cares about when buying: a ranked list (for example price, employee care, eco-responsible, fair trade) plus values tags in their own words. **Known only to the person who added it.** Feeds recommendations, blended with other signals; **not searchable, not a filter.** **Values tags are stored apart from other tags and are never shown** *(2026-10-01)*. **A values badge or banner is a high-level category made up of many values tags** *(2026-10-01)* — a few categories, not a tag cloud — **shown only if the Page owner chooses**, one at a time; the tags under it are never shown. Regular tags are always public and searchable. Draft F097, after launch.
  - **Currently** — no search or filter on a value; no value shown without its owner's choice; no single member's value history kept.
- **Badge** ○ *(2026-10-01)* — a high-level values category a Page owner chooses to show, made up of many private values tags. **The owner's own claim, worded "Says …"; nothing is verified today** (Don, 2026-10-01). Draft categories, for Don to edit (`planning/values-badges-draft.md`): **Locally owned · Made or grown nearby · Made by hand · Good jobs · Owned by its workers or members · Fair trade · Less waste · Secondhand and repair · Grown without harsh chemicals · Clean energy · Kind to animals · Gives back · Everyone welcome · Honest prices · Who owns it** (owner identity — Black-owned, women-owned, LGBTQ+-owned, veteran-owned and others, in the owner's words; *"identity is fine"*, Don, 2026-10-01).
  - **Can today** — nothing; no badge is built. Tags (public, searchable) are the only thing a Page carries.
  - **Can't today** — verify any claim; search or filter by badge; show the values tags under a badge.
  - **Later** — owner picks badges; each badge shows its one-line meaning when tapped; members can report a badge that doesn't match their visit (peer pressure for good, `policy.md`).
- **Ownership note** ○ *(2026-10-01)* — members telling other members who owns a business or brand, so recommendations can follow people's values: private-equity or corporate owned, B Corp, co-op and so on. Don: *"I know Peets Coffee is PE Owned and I can alert our members so businesses and products can be identified based on people's values."* **A member's note, not the platform's judgement** — it answers who makes the call in `product/needs/local-kinds.md` (the `pe-corporate` tier): members do. Feeds the recommendation engine as a pattern or an anti-pattern for members whose values care; it is not a public label.
  - **Can today** — nothing; reports exist only for content that breaks the rules.
  - **Can't today** — record a note about a business or brand that has no Page; check a note against a source.
  - **Later** — a note carries a link to its source and is worded as what members say, since it is a claim about a real company.
- **Feedback** ○ *(2026-10-01)* — what neighbours say they like or don't about a Page, like a business review. **Not published.** Anonymized and aggregated for the Page's owner. Not a rating of a person. Peer pressure for good (`policy.md`). Draft F097, after launch.
- **Consumer** *(2026-09-30)* — the other side from the creator, producer or organizer (the Page's owner or founder): a party to an RSVP or a transaction. A follower only watches. **Derived from an RSVP, a one-on-one meeting or a purchase, not stored.** Internal only, not a user-facing word.
- **Purchase** ○ *(2026-09-30)* — a member bought something from a business Page, confirmed by the seller, dated, with both members on it. **Not tracked yet; parked.** F077's sale half waits on it. Who sees a purchase is deferred with it (2026-09-30).
- **Discussion message** ○ — a reply on a Page's board, one level deep (not a tree). Member-authored top-level posts are a later increment and need an operator concept that doesn't exist yet.
- **Direct message** ○ — one person to another. No substrate exists at all. Never Location-scoped — the accountable-participation commitment is honoured by absence.
- **Idea** `○` *(schema `wonder`)* — someone puts a new thing to the neighbourhood and others signal interest before it exists.
  - **Never** — an expiry, or any conversion into another entry type *(2026-09-15, Don)*. The author creates the new Page themselves and announces or links it from the wonder.
  - **Now** — substrate only.
  - **Blocked** — the signalling / threshold / conversion mechanic is undesigned.
  - *The most distinctive thing in the positioning, and the hardest deferral on the list.*
- **Volunteering** `○` *(schema `offer`/`ask`)* — offering help, or asking for it.
  - **Now** — entry types exist, no composer.
  - **Blocked** — the missing reply channel, not the composer.
- **Appearance** ○ — a Page at a Venue for a bounded time. Cannot overlap in time, refused at creation.
- **Operator** `● now / ○ later` *(status corrected 2026-09-19 — the old line said "nothing exists yet" and three things do)* — whoever can remove someone else's content.
  - **Now** — **a check, and only a check.** `src/actions/_lib/operator.ts` compares the acting member against one env var, `OPERATOR_MEMBER_ID`, and **unset means nobody** — it fails closed, because the failure mode of the alternative is the whole moderation surface open to the internet. `reports`, `report_decisions` and the reviewing surface are on main; a decision is a reversible event.
  - **Later** — delegated reviewers, which is more than one operator and therefore a real identity rather than an env var.
  - **Never** — an operator role stored on a member. **There is still no roles table and no flag** — that part of the old line was right and survives. The singular, definite "the operator" in F058 is what the env var encodes.
- **Poll** ○ — `page_posts.kind='poll'` + `page_post_options`. Deliberately separate substrate from demand signals: a poll option is a row with a foreign key; a demand signal's subject has none, by design.

## Refused, and why

| Not a noun | Why |
|---|---|
| **Business entity** ✕ | No corporate shell between Persons and what they declare — every entry has a named human accountable for it. When a feature seems to want a corporate row: attach it to the Member or the business Group, never a shell. |
| **Role** ✕ | Roles are verbs a Member is doing, surfaced from activity. The moment a `role` enum lands on `members`, the primitive collapses into a directory-of-types. |
| **Follow on a product or service** ✕ | Ruled 2026-09-07 — people don't follow products. Removed as a concept, not deferred. |
| **Location-scoped messaging or feed** ✕ | No surface addresses everyone in a place — accountable participation, honoured by absence. |
| **Bulletin** ✕ | **A delivery mode, not a thing** *(2026-09-21, Don)*. It named one setting of an announcement's audience field — the addressed-and-pushed half — and an announcement is one noun whatever its audience. **Never a noun, an object type, or a label**, and never a creator-facing word: *Announcement* is the word everywhere, in the model, the docs and the product. Distinct from the six rejected role words, which are relations mistaken for things; this is a mode mistaken for one. The only thing ever built under the word is the retired `/you/vendor/bulletins` screen, which tracked *delivered / opened / clicked* — what `metrics.md` refuses. |
| **Cooperative governance** ✕ | Voting and distributions are off-platform verbs (securities law, operating agreements). A business Group with multiple owner-role memberships carries the cooperative *shape* without claiming to answer whether a vote is legally binding. |

**Why no Business entity, concretely:** the closest construct is a `kind='business'` Page — itself a group of Members, not a corporate record. Maya doesn't *have* a business; she's the sole owner-role member of a business Page, and what she files belongs to her. "Business name" on any surface is a business-Page label, not a separate record. This keeps the platform people-first structurally, not rhetorically, and makes cooperative formation a first-class outcome rather than a new entity type. Test for future proposals: does this give a business Page ownership of what is filed under it, or of other Pages, even indirectly? If yes, refuse.

## Who sees what

**The one place for visibility between people.** Filled from the rulings of 2026-09-30. **The default is social norms** — what people would expect socially (Don, 2026-09-30); a case the table doesn't cover is settled by that. `verbs.md` and `policy.md` point here.

**A Page is composed of components** *(Don, 2026-09-30)*: *"allow these components to be added on to any page for any reason ... with little explanations about how they can be used and how one might use them."* Any owner can add any of them, for any reason, and each comes with a short explanation of how it can be used. **Visibility is defined per component and relationship, not per Page type**; business and social are not rules.

| Component | At launch |
|---|---|
| Followers | ● built, on every Page |
| Members, with join approval | ● built, on every Page; approval ruled 2026-09-29 |
| Announcements | ● built, on every Page |
| RSVP gatherings | ● the Response on an occurrence, above |
| RSVP on a single post | ○ `ROADMAP.md` § Later, speculative |
| Transactions and one-on-ones | ○ `ROADMAP.md` § Later, speculative; purchasing deferred |

Each offered component's explanation, and the way an owner adds one, are new launch scope (2026-09-30). Levels on a Page that isn't a group Page, and switching following or joining off, also wait in `ROADMAP.md` § Later.

**Viewers.** *Signed out* — the general public, *"the one on the street after all the businesses are closed"* (Don). *Signed in* — no relation to the Page. *Follower* — watches the Page, takes no part. *Member* — of this Page; membership is scoped to the Page and there is no MSA-wide community; a member gets everything a follower does (2026-09-29). *RSVP party* — RSVP'd to one of the Page's gatherings, or to a single post, which covers that post only. *Transaction party* — one side of a one-on-one meeting or a purchase. *Runner* — the Page's creator, owner or steward. A **consumer** is a party to an RSVP or a transaction; a follower only watches.

**Where each cell comes from.** Member fields and interest tags: nobody reads anything about a member, only what they post; a creator may show their own display name and avatar on their Page (2026-09-30). Front door: a business closed for the night, the same for every Page, and it doesn't show the founder or seller; the card's words are placeholder copy (2026-09-30). Contents: a signed-in non-member sees the front door plus what the owner makes visible to the MSA; private, community-only and public are levels on group Pages; community-only means the Page's own members and can have followers; a private Page has members, not followers (2026-09-15). Roster: a stranger doesn't see it (2026-09-30); current members see each other (2026-09-08). Follow graph: nobody sees who follows whom, and a runner sees who follows their Page (2026-09-30). RSVPs: whoever is party to an RSVP sees what that gathering's parties see, and a post RSVP covers that post only (2026-09-30); the count is the Response entry above. One-on-one meetings and transactions: only the parties, as far as it needs; without a transaction it can be visible (2026-09-30); purchasing is deferred. Legal name: **we currently show it to no member**; it is collected for the platform's protection and seen only by Don and operators, and real names between people who dealt with each other are out of scope until counsel (F077, 2026-09-30). Announcements: the public/followers switch (2026-09-21), no third audience (2026-09-30), a public one reaches everyone whatever the Page's level (2026-09-30), the signed-out card (F093). Don and operators see what the platform collects for its protection (2026-09-30), outside this table.

**Combinations.** A member with several relationships to a Page sees the union of their columns, and nothing extra (2026-09-30). Someone who runs one Page is a stranger to another.


### Nouns this needs

- **Purchase** — ○ below: a confirmed purchase is not tracked yet.
- **Confirmed interaction** — a Response confirmed by the organiser, or a Purchase confirmed by the seller, dated, with both members on it (F077, out of scope for now). A state on those two nouns, not a noun of its own.
- **A Page's visibility level** — a field on a group Page, not a noun. It sits on members today and moves (`socialus-web` #246).

## The relationships

**Retired as prose, 2026-09-19. The link model lives in one place and this is not it:** `src/ontology/links.ts` in `socialus-web`, generated to `src/ontology/registry.json` (schema 2) and checked against the handlers by `scripts/ontology-drift.ts`, which runs daily.

[open-question owner=don raised=2026-09-16] Which noun does the paused ontology spike model first — Item or Page? The spike lives outside this repo, at `../socialus-ontology-spike/INTENT.md`.

**Why the paragraph that stood here is gone rather than corrected.** It was the second description of the link model and the one people read to be right, while **nothing checked it** — the failure this repo is named for. It had already drifted: it listed *"Person↔Page: founder/steward/owner/member of"* as one relation, and those are **two links with different meanings**. Ownership is `groups.founder_member_id` — who *started* the Page, which **no permission consults**. Authority is `group_memberships.role` — `owner` or `steward`, which is what every managing check actually reads. They coincide today only because one handler writes both, and **a steward who did not found a Page holds authority under the second and appears under neither of the others**. That link was undeclared until 2026-09-19.

**What to read instead, by question:**

| Question | Where |
|---|---|
| Which relationships are declared, and which are declared-but-unbuilt | `registry.json` → `links`, each with its table, column, writing handlers and `built` flag |
| Which handler writes a given link | that link's `writtenBy` |
| Whether the declaration still matches the code | `scripts/ontology-drift.ts`, daily; its verdict is reported in `STATUS.md`, not re-derived here |
| The shape of the registry at a glance | `STATUS.md` § The ontology — what is declared |

**What stays here, because it is a refusal and not a link:** **the relationship surface is intentionally flat.** There is no Business that owns entries at a Location and employs Persons — see § Refused, and why. A registry can say what exists; only this file says what may never be added.
