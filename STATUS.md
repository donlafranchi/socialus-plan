Launch **2026-10-30**, one metro. 29 days out.

**20 of 22 approved and building scenarios are unverified** — no check is marked as discharging any
of their criteria. Unmarked is unverified, not verified. § Guard coverage.

**Native apps: 7 gaps for iOS, 6 for Android** — `PLATFORM-IOS.md`, `PLATFORM-ANDROID.md`.

## Scenarios, by status

| approved | building | draft | deferred |
|---|---|---|---|
| 18 | 4 | 20 | 1 |

**Building:**
- F060 (Someone starts something without opening a shop)
- F061 (Someone creates a Page worth showing people)
- F069 (A non-business Page resolves everywhere, and holding several is ordinary)
- F070 (Every Page has a face, even without a photo)

**`building` is frontmatter, not evidence** — nothing checks it against a
branch or a commit.

## In the code repo

**54 issues open** in `socialus-web`, 10 launch-blocking:
- #205 bug · Onboarding assigns every new member a fictional home place, with no picker
- #219 F077 · Real names only between people who actually interacted; display name everywhere else
- #220 F078 · Flagged content hides itself on the agent's call, and the poster is told why
- #221 F080 · No pictures of children, from anyone — detection point needs Don
- #222 F081 · One signup for everyone: four fields, and the zip sets the metro
- #223 F082 · One self-attestation before a first Page, selling and hosting alike
- #246 bug · What one member can read about another: the signed-in half of #241, and four member tables open to anyone
- #257 F091 · T176 · What's happening, today and this week
- #262 F072 · T179 · an optional end time on announcements and gatherings, shown as 7–9pm
- #269 chore · T182 · a local seeded stack with a persona per role, the browser suite running in CI, and a screenshot matrix

**72 PRs merged in the last fortnight.** The newest five:
- #277 2026-10-01 bug #276: Page edit asks before Done or leaving discards unsaved changes
- #275 2026-10-01 bug #274: Create opens the create flow instead of looping back to "Tap Create"
- #271 2026-10-01 bug #270: signed-in Explore no longer nests a list item inside a list item, so it hydrates
- #268 2026-10-01 bug #267: an owner sees no Follow or Report on their own Page, and unfollowing never ends their ownership
- #265 2026-10-01 chore #264: the production apply refuses a stacked branch, and more than one pending migration without an override

### Needs a look — not a claim that anything is wrong

*A commit naming a ticket is not proof the ticket is done: partial work
counts. Each row needs a look, not a close.*

- **#84 open, but T159 appears on main** — chore · T159 is two different tickets — renumber one in ops-pattern
- **#53 open, but T156 appears on main** — F059 · T156 · Browse renders Pages
- **#52 open, but T155 appears on main** — F059 · T155 · Feed vantage point becomes a metro
- **#51 open, but T154 appears on main** — F059 · T154 · Browse reads Pages, not Items
- **#30 open, but T149 appears on main** — chore · T149 · Retire vendor routes for real
- **#16 open, but T126 appears on main** — F056 · T126 · Edit shop — image, description, values
- **#15 open, but T125 appears on main** — F057 · T125 · You gains a producer state

### Still on main, meant to be gone

- `/following` still present — src/app/following/page.tsx
- `members.maker_mode_enabled` still in the schema

## The ontology — what is declared

- **13 link types declared**, 11 built. Registry schema 2.
- **Declared but not built (2)** - the relationship is named and nothing writes it yet:
  - a Member supports a Page
  - an Announcement is at a Location
- **7 object types declared**: Member (live), Page (live), Item (live), Location (live), Place (live), Announcement (live), Tag (live).
- **Rejected as nouns (6)** - named so they stay rejected: Person, Creator, Organizer, Follower, Patron, Vendor.
- **28 handlers, of which 17 write no declared link.**
  Not a fault on its own - a handler may legitimately touch no relationship -
  but an undeclared link lives here if it lives anywhere:
  - group.member_join
  - group.member_leave
  - group.post_edit
  - item.publish
  - member.business_jurisdiction.remove
  - member.business_jurisdiction.set
  - member.create
  - member.interests.add
  - member.place_interest.add
  - member.place_interest.remove
  - member.saved_search.remove
  - member.saved_search.restore
  - metro.waitlist_join
  - metro.waitlist_join_anonymous
  - report.create
  - report.decide
  - report.reverse

## What CI last said

- **`deploy-health.yml`** — success, 2026-10-01
  - Database reachable from the deployment: success
  - Ontology declarations still match the code: success
- **`ci.yml`** — success, 2026-10-01
  - Unit tests: success
  - Lint, types, build: success
  - Migrations applied to production: skipped

## Measured, not estimated

- Copy: 584 strings across 118 files — source `docs/copy-inventory.md` on origin/main
- Routes on origin/main: 23
- Migrations on origin/main: 67

## Deferred on purpose — and therefore easy to forget

Ruled acceptable with a condition for looking again. The ruling itself is a
dated line in `DECISIONS.md`; the register is `accepted-risks/`.

**3 need a look now.**

- **observability: no error tracking in production** — **due in 15 days**
  - If forgotten: A runtime error for a real member is invisible. Nobody is paged, nothing is logged where anyone looks, and the first signal is a person giving up and not saying why. The DATABASE_URL outage went four months unnoticed for exactly this reason.
  - Look again if: ANY of: a member outside the team signs up; a bug is reported that nobody can reproduce; or 2026-10-16 passes with this still open.
- **ci: playwright suite exists but no workflow runs it** — **due in 15 days**
  - If forgotten: The end-to-end tests rot. Nobody runs them, they drift from the app, and the day someone needs them they no longer pass for reasons unrelated to the bug being chased — at which point they get deleted instead of fixed.
  - Look again if: ANY of: a regression reaches production that a browser test would have caught; the Playwright suite fails to run locally when someone next tries it; or 2026-10-16 passes with this still open.
- **storage: removed photo bytes stay fetchable by direct URL** — **due in 15 days**
  - If forgotten: A photo the operator removed stays downloadable, indefinitely, by anyone who has or can guess its storage URL. For ordinary bad content that is tolerable. For illegal content it is not, and 'we kept it so it could be reversed' is not a defensible answer to a regulator, a police request, or the person in the photo.
  - Look again if: ANY of: the first report of illegal content reaches the review queue; a member asks for their own photo to be actually deleted rather than taken down; a takedown demand arrives from outside the platform; or 2026-10-16 passes (two weeks before launch) with this still open.
- **data: two rows in public.places share the slug 'sacramento'** — review by 2026-11-30
  - If forgotten: A scoped link resolves to the wrong geography and nobody notices, because both answers look plausible. The heuristic makes it deterministic and therefore silent.
  - Look again if: ANY of: a member reports results from the wrong area; a third row appears with the same slug; a browse or scope read starts resolving places by SLUG rather than by id; or 2026-11-30 passes. (The T156 browse query rewrite landed 2026-09-19 and takes place and metro IDs, never slugs, deliberately — so that trigger did NOT fire and this stays a live tripwire for the next read that does.)
- **schema: reports.reviewed_at/reviewed_by_member_id/outcome duplicate report_decisions** — review by 2026-11-30
  - If forgotten: Two sources of truth drift. A write path that updates the decisions log and forgets the projection leaves a report invisible in the queue or double-counted against a reporter's cap, and the bug looks like a UI fault rather than a schema one.
  - Look again if: ANY of: a third writer of report_decisions appears; delegated reviewers land (more writers, more chances to drift); the queue shows a report whose status disagrees with its history; or 2026-11-30 passes.

## Guard coverage

**20 of 22 approved and building scenarios are unverified — no check is marked
as discharging any criterion of theirs, so a contradiction in them cannot surface here.** Unmarked
is unverified, not verified: nothing says a check exists, and under `[guard-proves-itself]` that
counts as absent. A **partial** criterion has checks that cover only part of it, named with what
they leave out; parts never add up to covered. Full map: `python3 scripts/markers.py coverage`.

- **F080** · 1 of 5 covered · unclaimed: 1, 2, 3, 4
- **F093** · 4 of 12 covered · **partial: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9** · unclaimed: 10, 11, 12
- **Unverified — no marked check at all** (20): F056, F057, F058, F059, F060, F061, F063, F064, F065, F069, F070, F072, F074, F076, F077, F078, F081, F082, F091, F092

## Is `building` backed by code?

Each scenario whose frontmatter says `building`, against what names it in `socialus-web`: commits
and files on main, and branches. Frontmatter is a claim; this is the evidence.

- **F060** · 0 commits on main · 5 files naming it · 0 branches
- **F061** · 0 commits on main · 12 files naming it · 0 branches
- **F069** · **nothing in the code names it** — no commit, file or branch
- **F070** · 6 commits on main · 14 files naming it · 0 branches

## Gating launch — does each have an Issue?

Every scenario whose frontmatter says `gates: launch`, against the `socialus-web` Issues
naming it. Five approved gating scenarios once had none, and nothing noticed.

- **F058** (approved) · #62 closed, #61 closed, #13 closed, #12 closed
- **F076** (approved) · #194 closed, #193 closed, #77 closed
- **F078** (approved) · #220 open
- **F080** (approved) · #221 open
- **F081** (approved) · #222 open
- **F082** (approved) · #223 open
- **F093** (approved) · #252 closed, #215 closed

**Rulings that bind code: 73.** Each names its Issue or scenario, or says it has nothing to build;
the lint fails one that does none of the three — the identity leaks sat eight days with no Issue.

## What this run could not verify

- **The 20 drafts.** Status alone does not say which are waiting
  on Don and which are simply unfinished.
