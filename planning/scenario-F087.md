title: One create flow, and what you call it depends on what you are starting

## Story

Priya wants to convene a Tuesday run. Marcus wants to sell hot sauce. Dana is starting a monthly repair meetup. All three tap the same control and are asked one question first: what are you starting? Priya picks hosting a gathering, Marcus picks opening a shop, Dana picks starting a group. From there each sees a flow written in their own words, offering the tools their thing needs and not the ones it doesn't. Underneath, all three just created a Page. **None of them was ever told to open a shop in order to do something that isn't a shop.**

## Acceptance

1. **Every path through the create flow produces a Page.** An event is a post a Page makes, with no Page of its own (2026-10-01). There is no second entity, no alternative record, and no path that creates something else. *(Confirmed by Don 2026-09-15; `nouns.md`'s "no Page for a single occasion" was overruled the same day.)*
2. **Purpose is chosen first, from a named set**, before any other field. Nothing is pre-selected and nothing is inferred.
3. **The words shown to the person differ by purpose** — headings, labels, buttons, and the confirmation. Opening a shop, posting a gathering and starting a group read as three different things.
4. **The tools offered differ by purpose.** A purpose's flow omits steps its thing does not need, rather than showing them disabled or skippable.
5. **"Shop" never names the general act.** No string outside the shop purpose calls creating a Page opening a shop, and no person reaches a shop-worded step from a non-shop purpose.
6. **Every Page is an organization; the chosen type — Business (enterprise) or Social group — is stored and changeable any time in Page settings** (Don, 2026-10-05). Use cases are presets under the two types, and the type sets only the defaults a new Page starts with; any component can still be added to any Page (dispatch-decided 2026-10-05; Don can override). Locally owned is offered to businesses only. It confers no permission.

## Not this

Converting one Page into another — rejected outright since 2026-09-07 and still rejected. Creating two Pages at once; they are made sequentially. The business claim, which remains the friction gate and is separate from the purpose dropdown. Naming the members of the purpose set — that is Don's, and criterion 2 only requires it be named and closed.

## Why

### What this dissolves

**"Hosting requires opening a shop first" was never a missing substrate. It was a label on a door.** A 2026-09-15 read of the project named it the one awkward thing a person meets today; F060 already ticketed the entry point. This scenario makes the fix general instead of a special case for hosts.

### Checked against what is already approved — no conflict on self-classification

**The dropdown classifies the thing, not the person, and that is exactly what the existing rules ask for.** F060 criterion 2: *"`/you/create`'s first question is what they're starting, not what they are — no self-classification anywhere in the flow."* Don's dropdown asks what they are starting. **The rules it might have collided with are all about the person:** no stored role on a member, no account type, no umbrella noun for a person. None is touched.

**And a prior ruling already asked for this.** `DECISIONS.md`, 2026-09-07: *"Different creation flows per type is correct; nothing ever mutates."* F087 is that ruling built.

### The purposes themselves

**Named, defined, and sized in `product/systems/page-kinds.md`** (draft, 2026-09-15): someone selling, someone with a recurring gathering, and a deliberately thinner one-time gathering. That document carries what each needs at minimum, what it does not need, the schema recommendation, and the full list of what the thin one lacks.

### Settled — the one-time gathering

**Don ruled 2026-09-15:** *"We can create a page for every kind. It just doesn't require all of the same tools. It would still require an announcement and perhaps a following list and later messaging etc."*

**What differs between Pages is the tools.** *(The one-off Page went 2026-10-01: an event is a post.)* Every Page gets a baseline — announcing, and a following list — with messaging later. `nouns.md` was amended the same day; criterion 1 stands as written and is no longer in conflict.

**What this costs is in `planning/ONE-MODEL.md`** — the baseline is not free, and neither half of it has a writer today.
